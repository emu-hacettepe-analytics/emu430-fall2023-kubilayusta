\# Assignment 1

My first assignment has three parts.

# **(a) R vs Python \| Which is Better for Data Analysis?**

**In this article, I am talking about a content called R vs Python by Alex Freberg, a successful data analyst, that I found on YouTube.**

**The date the video was published is February 16, 2021. Therefore, there may be some differences today.**

|-------------|-------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **R**         | \- Programming language developed for statistical analysis                | **Python**    | \- It is a general-purpose programming language                   |
|               | \- Developed in 1993 and used by statisticians, data miners, and analysts |               | \- Quickly becoming one of the most popular programming languages |
|               | \- Used by companies like Uber, Facebook, and Google                      |               | \- Used by companies like Google, Facebook, and Netflix           |
| **Libraries** | \- **Data Collection:** Rcrawler, readxl, readr, RCurl                    | **Libraries** | \- **Data Collection:** Pandas, Requests, BeautifulSoup           |

| **The Code**  | \- Easy/Medium difficulty to pick up                                      | **The Code**  | \- Easy/Medium difficulty to pick up and learn                    |
|               | \- Can be difficult to maintain                                           |               | \- Easier to write maintainable, large-scale code                 |

**In conclusion, Alex says "It depends!". On the subject that does not have a clear answer.**

**He says that:**

**R is harder to learn and if you are doing statistical work, R is better.**

**Python is easy to learn and if you are doing machine learning, Python is better.**

**Try both!**

# **(b) Differences between R and Python**

1.  **Variable Assignment**

    -   **R is using " \<- " operator for assignment.**

        -   **Code Example:**


            ```{r}
            x <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

            sum_x <- sum(x)
            
            print(sum_x)
            ```

    -   **Python is using " = " operator for assignment.**

        -   **Code Example:**


            ```{python, python.reticulate = FALSE}
            x = [1,2,3,4,5]

            sum_x = sum(x)
            
            print(sum_x)
            ```
2.  **Function Definitions:**

    -   **Functions are defined using the " function " keyword in R.**

        -   **Code Example:**
            ```{r}
            numbers <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
            
            mean <- function(arg)

            {

            sum(arg) / length(arg)

            }
            
            print(mean(numbers))
            ```

            

    -   **Functions are defined using the " def " keyword in Python.**

        -   **Code Example:**

            ```{python, python.reticulate = FALSE}
            numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
            
            def mean(arg):
              
              return sum(arg) / len(arg)
              
            print(mean(numbers))
            ```
3.  **Syntax differences in code chunks:**

    -   **In R we use " { } " syntax for code chunk.**

        -   **Code Example:**

            ```{r}
            number <- 5
            
            if (number %% 2 == 0){
            print("Number is even")
            } else {
            print("Number is not even")
            }
            ```

    -   **In Python we use " : " syntax for code chunk.**

        -   **Code Example:**
          
            ```{python, python.reticulate = FALSE}
            number = 5
            
            if number % 2 == 0:
              print("Number is even")
            
            else:
              print("Number is not even")
            ```

# **(c) Organizing Data Set**

-   **Installing Na_Example**

```{r}
#| output: false
#| code-tools: true
#| code-fold: true
install.packages("dslabs", repos = " https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dslabs")
library("dslabs")
data(package = "dslabs")
list.files(system.file("script", package = "dslabs"))
data("admissions")
library(tidyverse)
zero_example <- ifelse(is.na(na_example), 0, na_example)
```

-   **Datas with NA**

```{r}
#| code-tools: true
#| code-fold: true
print(na_example) 

```

# 

-   **Datas with ZERO**

```{r}
print(zero_example)
```
